## Overview
Â» It's a solution for the [frontend mentor code challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca) that I did to practice my React abilities and at the same time to improve my handling of tailwind CSS and typescript. This time I worked with an API to fetch data of different countries and filtering & displaying it in many ways. Then I also added the switch for dark/light theme (Dark mode makes all better).
